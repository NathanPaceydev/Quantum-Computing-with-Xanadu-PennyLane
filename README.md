# Quantum Computing with Xanadu's PennyLane
My solutions to the Quantum Computing Codebooks produced by Xanadu using the python library PennyLane. **This code and information in this repository is for educational purposes only**.

**Xanadu Codebook Solutions.ipynb** contains the questions and solutions to the introduction modules T, I and A.
Grover's Algoorithm Xanadu codebook.ipynb contains the questions and solutions to the Grover's Module

I also included an example of using Grover's algorithm compared to a conventional searching/sorting algorithm in the file: **Multi-Variable Grover's Alogithm Example.ipynb**

To learn more about Quantum Computing and Grover's Algorithm I included my Final report for ENPH 344 including a presentaion on Grover's Alorithm.
